# flaschenpost_backend

Simple backend. Is written using NET6 (So to be able to run program, please install runtime or sdk)

To start program clone branch in your favourite IDE and type command - dotnet run

Application uses port 5229, so it should be free.

I did not write any UT or Integration tests, but I know that in real life projects they should be.
